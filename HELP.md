### **How to start using GalacticCom?**

*   **Registration:** Create a new account by choosing a unique nickname, email, and password. You can also choose your home galaxy, star, and planet!
*   **Login:** After creating your account and verifying your email, you can log in to start exploring.

---

### **How do public messages work?**

The main screen shows public messages from other users in your current galaxy.

*   **Balloon View:** See messages floating like balloons. They expire after 12 hours.
*   **List View:** See a more traditional list of messages.
*   **Toggle View:** To switch between Balloon View and List View, simply **long press the "Broadcast" icon** in the bottom navigation menu.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** New messages will appear in real-time.
*   **Persistence:** Messages are bound to the galaxy where they were sent. If you travel to another galaxy, you will stop seeing messages from your previous location, but they are not deleted. If you return later, they will still be there.

---

### **How can I start a private conversation?**

You can start a private conversation by replying to a public message. You can send text, images, GIFs, and voice messages (with a 1-minute limit).

---

### **Are private conversations secure?**

Yes. Once both users have joined the chat, it becomes **end-to-end encrypted**. This means only you and the other person can read the messages. For maximum security, the encryption keys are stored **only on your device**. If you reinstall the app or change phones, your old encrypted messages will not be recoverable, protecting your privacy.

---

### **What happens when I delete a conversation?**

When you delete a private conversation from your Inbox, it is **deleted for both users**. This ensures that the connection is completely severed. The original public message that started the chat will then become visible to both of you again.

---

### **How does Resource Mining work?**

In the "System" screen, your equipment will automatically mine resources from your current planet. This is a great way to earn Credits!

*   **Passive Mining:** Resources like Iron Ore, Gold Dust, and more are automatically extracted over time. You don't need to keep the app open.
*   **Collect Your Cargo:** The mined resources are held in a temporary cargo bay. You must periodically tap the "Collect Cargo" button to move them into your permanent inventory.
*   **System Overheat:** Your mining equipment generates stress. After 4 hours of continuous operation, it will overheat and pause mining. You can wait for it to cool down or watch a rewarded ad to cool it down instantly.
*   **Planet Reserves:** Each planet has a finite amount of resources. Once depleted, you'll need to find a new system to continue mining. You can also watch a rewarded ad to "Recharge Energy," which adds new reserves to the current planet.

---

### **Are there limits on sending messages?**

Yes, to ensure fair play and prevent spam, there are daily limits:
*   **Public Messages:** You have a daily limit for broadcasting to deep space. This limit resets every day.
*   **Private Messages:** You have a daily limit of 50 private messages. This limit resets every day.

If you reach these limits, you can purchase items from the Pirate Store to continue communicating.

---

### **How do I travel to other galaxies or planets?**

*   **Intergalactic Travel:** Use the Galaxy Directory to travel to other galaxies. The list only shows galaxies currently inhabited by other users. To switch between the List View and Map View of the galaxies, **long press the "Cosmos" icon** in the bottom navigation menu.
*   **Planetary Travel:** Use the "Find New System" button in the "System" screen to travel to a new planet within your current galaxy. This is useful for finding planets with fresh resource reserves.

---

### **Are there limits on travel?**

Yes. There is a weekly limit on how many times you can travel between galaxies and a daily limit for finding a new planetary system.

---

### **Who is the Pirate Merchant (Captain Harlock)?**

Captain Harlock is a pirate merchant who appears in a random galaxy for a limited time (usually 1 hour). He buys and sells rare goods. When he is in your galaxy, you'll see a special Pirate Ship icon floating on the main screen. Tap it to open his store.

---

### **What items does Captain Harlock sell?**

You can buy special items using your **Credits**:

*   **Hyperwave Booster:** Allows you to send your next public transmission instantly, bypassing the usual travel time.
*   **Clandestine Cargo:** A pack of 250 extra private messages to use when you hit your daily limit.
*   **Private Communication License:** Extra licenses to send public broadcasts beyond your daily limit.
*   **Avatar Seed:** Allows you to regenerate your avatar even if you've reached your monthly limit.
*   **Lone Traveler's Emblem:** A prestigious golden star badge that appears next to your name on your profile.

---

### **Can I sell things to the Pirate Merchant?**

Yes! Captain Harlock is always looking for valuable resources. You can sell him the following items for Credits:
*   Iron Ore
*   Gold Dust
*   Plasma Crystal
*   Dark Matter

---

### **How will I know when the Pirate Merchant arrives?**

You no longer have to worry about missing out on rare goods! The moment Captain Harlock arrives in your galaxy, you will receive a **push notification** on your device. This will happen even if the GalacticCom app is closed, so you'll always be the first to know when there's an opportunity for a great deal.

---

### **Can I change my avatar?**

Yes, you can regenerate your avatar in your user profile. However, there is a monthly limit on how many times you can do this. If you need more changes, visit the Pirate Store.

---

### **How can I change my profile or manage my account?**

You can edit your nickname and bio in the Settings. You can also manage your account, including deleting it if you wish.
