# GalacticCom: A Personal Odyssey in Space

**Forget everything you know about social media. GalacticCom is not just an app; it's a shared universe in your pocket, where every user is an anonymous traveler exploring and communicating across the stars.**


---

## 🌌 Your Cosmic Identity

Your journey begins the moment you enter GalacticCom. Here, you are not a "user"; you are a **Traveler**.

*   **Create Your Legend:** Choose a pseudonym to be known by among the stars.
*   **A Face Like No Other:** Your traveler name serves as a seed to generate a unique procedural alien avatar. No two are alike. Your visual identity is as singular as you are.
*   **Find Your Home:** The universe assigns you a starting point: a **galaxy**, a **star**, and a **planet** to call home. This is your place in the cosmos.

## 📡 The Art of Interstellar Communication

In GalacticCom, words have weight and travel physically through space. Communication is an art divided into two distinct experiences.

### Casting a Transmission into the Void

On the **Transmit** screen, you can share your thoughts with the cosmos. But there are rules:

*   **Limited Broadcasts:** Resources are scarce in deep space. You can only send a limited number of public transmissions per day. Choose your words wisely.
*   **A Message:** Your message is launched into the void and travels to a **random galaxy**, where a lucky inhabitant may receive it. You never know who will hear your voice.
*   **The Test of Patience:** Your words take time to cross the universe. The arrival time depends on your experience as a communicator.

### Tuning into the Echoes

On the **Broadcast** screen, you don't speak; you listen. Tune your consciousness to capture the transmissions of other travelers echoing in **your current galaxy**.

*   **Thought Balloons:** Messages appear as ephemeral balloons of energy. Catch them before they fade away.
*   **Intercept & Connect:** If a message resonates with you, "intercept" it to open a private, secure channel with the sender.

### Secure & Private Comms

When you connect with another traveler, a private link is established.

*   **End-to-End Encrypted:** Your private chats are secured with military-grade encryption. Only you and the other person can read them. Keys are stored only on your device.
*   **Rich Media:** Share images, GIFs, and short voice transmissions to bridge the distance.
*   **Symmetrical Deletion:** Privacy is paramount. If one person deletes the conversation, it vanishes for **both**, severing the link completely.

---

## ⚡ The Chaos of the Cosmos

The universe is not a safe place. Your transmissions are at the mercy of cosmic events that add a layer of strategy and unpredictability:

*   **Solar Storms:** Can **corrupt** parts of your message, altering its meaning.
*   **Gravitational Anomalies:** Can **delay** your transmission, drastically increasing travel time.

You will have to be patient and adapt. Your ability to communicate despite the challenges will prove your worth.

## ⛏️ Harvesting the Stars

Survival in space requires resources. Your ship is equipped with autonomous mining drones that operate while you explore.

*   **Passive Extraction:** Your systems automatically mine valuable resources from your current planet—**Iron Ore, Gold Dust, Plasma Crystals, and Dark Matter**.
*   **System Overheat:** Your equipment cannot run forever. After intense mining sessions, systems will overheat and require a cooldown period. Manage your energy wisely.
*   **Trade for Survival:** These resources are not just for show. Accumulate them to trade with merchants for **Credits**, the currency of the void.

## 🏴‍☠️ Encounters in the Void: Captain Harlock

The universe is vast, but not empty. Keep your sensors active for rare encounters.

*   **The Pirate Merchant:** Rumors speak of a mysterious merchant, **Captain Harlock**, who travels the galaxies aboard his ship, "The Star Nomad." He appears without warning in inhabited systems for a limited time.
*   **Black Market Goods:** The Captain trades in exotic items you can't find anywhere else:
    *   **Hyperwave Boosters** for instant message delivery.
    *   **Clandestine Cargo** to bypass communication limits.
    *   **Avatar Seeds** to reshape your identity.
    *   **The Lone Traveler's Emblem**, a prestigious badge of honor.
*   **The Price of Experience:** The Captain does not deal in common currencies. He only accepts **Credits** obtained from your mining operations. Will you sell your resources to upgrade your capabilities? The choice is yours.

## 🚀 Explore a Living Universe

You are not confined to your home system. GalacticCom is a game of exploration.

*   **The Galaxy Directory:** Access a map of all known galaxies. See their morphology, age, and population.
*   **The Great Journey:** Intergalactic travel is a significant event that **takes time** and has weekly limits. Choose your destination carefully—leaving a galaxy means leaving its messages behind.
*   **Find a New System:** Seek out a new star system and planet within your current galaxy for a change of scenery.

---

## 🏅 A Legacy in the Stars

GalacticCom is a long-term journey. Your actions echo through time, earning you badges of honor that tell your story.

*   **Achievements of Legend:** From the **"Observer of Ages"** for years of service, to **"The Murano Glass Bottle"** for messages that travel far and wide.
*   **Rare Feats:** Prove your worth by becoming an **"Admiral of the Ghost Fleet"** or a **"Dark Matter Miner"**.
*   **A Ten-Year Odyssey:** This is not a sprint. Some badges require dedication over a decade, rewarding the true guardians of the cosmos.
