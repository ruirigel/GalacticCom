It is strictly forbidden to create, share, or request any content that depicts, promotes, or relates to child sexual abuse or exploitation. This includes:

*   Images, videos, or illustrations of child sexual abuse (CSAM).
*   Text-based content that describes or encourages sexual acts involving minors.
*   Any communication that seeks to groom, solicit, or endanger a minor.

## 3. Reporting Mechanisms

User safety is a shared responsibility. We empower our users to report any content or user that violates this policy.

*   **In-App Reporting:** All public and private messages within GalacticCom have a reporting feature. Users can flag suspicious content or users directly within the app for our review.
*   **Contacting Us:** Users or non-users can report concerns directly by contacting our support team.

All reports are treated with urgency and confidentiality.

Upon receiving a report or detecting a violation, we will take immediate and decisive action, which may include:

*   **Content Removal:** Immediate deletion of the offending content.
*   **Account Termination:** Permanent suspension or deletion of the responsible user's account.
*   **Reporting to Authorities:** We are legally and morally obligated to report any and all instances of CSAM to the relevant national and international authorities, such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the United States and other competent law enforcement agencies.
